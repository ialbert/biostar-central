<h3>About NeuroStars</h3>
<p>
    Initially conceived by <a href='http://github.com/ialbert'>Istvan Albert</a>'s highly successful <a href='http://www.biostars.org'>BioStar</a> website within the <b>Bioinformatics</b> community, <b>NeuroStars</b> is born as an experiment to engage the <b>Neuroinformatics</b> community after some <a href='http://meta.cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/271/neuroinformatics-and-cognitive-sciences'>unfruitful attempts</a> in <a href='http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/38069/neuroinformatics/'>StackExchange's Area51</a>.
</p>
<p>
    For the academics, there is a great <a href='http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002216'>paper in PLoS Computational Biology</a> that explains how to operate this site ;)
</p>
<p>
This site's focus is <b>neuroinformatics</b> and <b>neuroscience</b>. We welcome posts that are:
    <ul>
        <li>detailed and specific, written clearly and simply.</li>
    </ul>

    No question is too trivial or too "newbie". Please use the search to see if your
    question has already been asked (perhaps even answered!) before you ask. But if you end up asking a question that has been asked before, that is fine too. Other users will hopefully edit in links to related or similar questions to help future visitors find their way.
