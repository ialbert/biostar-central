These need to be added into the post body and will not    be viewable in the preview. The transformations get applied only after submitting:    <ul>        <li>            <b>Posts</b>: the text with a proper <i>link</i> to a post with url like            <code>http://www.neurostars.org/p/1</code>            will be replaced by the post title.            <a href="http://www.neurostars.org/p/1">This text</a> is a valid example of text            with a proper link to a post;        </li>        <li>            <b>Users</b>: the text with a proper <i>link</i> to a user with url like            <code>http://www.neurostars.org/u/1</code>            will be replaced by the user's display name.            <a href="http://www.neurostars.org/u/1">This text</a> is a valid example of text            with a proper link to a user;        </li>        <li>            <b>Gist</b>: the <i>text</i> in the form            <code>https://gist.github.com/schacon/1</code>            will embed the relative gist;        </li>        <li>            <b>YouTube</b>: the <i>text</i> in the form            <code>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVpbFMhOAwE</code>            will embed the relative video;        </li>        <li>            <b>Twitter</b>: the <i>text</i> in the form            <code>https://twitter.com/Linux/status/2311234267</code>            will embed the relative tweet.        </li>    </ul></p><h3>RSS Feeds</h3><p>    We offer RSS feeds to many different sources of information.    See the <a href='../rss/'>Feeds page</a></p> <h3>Searching by multiple tags</h3><p>    To build URL that returns posts that match multiple tags separate these with <code>+</code> (plus) sign.    For example: <a href="/t/galaxy+bwa+tutorial/">/t/galaxy+bwa+tutorial/</a>. Similarly     to exclude a tag add the exclamation suffix to it like this <code>blast!</code>.    You can combine them like so  <a href="/t/tutorial+sequence+blast!/">/t/tutorial+sequence+blast!/</a></p><h3>Setting an avatar image</h3><p>    Sign up at <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> and also set your email in <b>NeuroStars</b> to match    the email that is registered at <b>Gravatar</b>.</p>     <h3>Appropriate Content</h3><p>    This site's focus is neuroinformatics, computational neuroscience and neuroscience data analysis.    Only posts on these topics or those pertaining to NeuroStars itself are allowed.    The <b>Questions</b> section requires that a post be formulated as a question. All other    type of post, annoucements or discussions should go under the <b>Forum</b> category. Moderators    will reclassify posts that do not belong to the correct category.</p>    <h3>Removing content</h3><p>    Posts may be removed or may be set deleted (invisible) status. Only the author of a post may remove it     withouth a trace. Moreover this action is only available as long as the post does not have other posts attached to it as     answers or comments. In all other cases the post can only be deleted (set to be invisible), and the delete action    is reversible. Please contact the site managers/administrators if you feel strongly that certain content    needs to be removed.</p><h3>Moderation guidelines</h3><p>    Users posting content that does not belong to the site will be notified and required to edit their content. Users may post commercially motivated posts to the Forum section as long as the topic aligns with the main focus of this site.    Users posting obvious spam will be immediately suspended.</p> <h3>The FixMe category</h3><p>    Moderators may reclassify incorrectly formulated posts with the <b>FixMe</b> category. These post will not show up in the questions section.    The authors of these posts will periodically receive a notification that they have posts that need further editing.    Once edited the post type needs to be changed back to the original type.</p><h3>Voting</h3><p>    Each user has access to up to <b>10</b> votes every six hours. Users asking questions are encouraged to click accept (<i class="icon-ok"></i>) to indicate contributions that fully answer the question. Note that multiple answers may be accepted on a question, thus the author of a question can reward excellent answers with both an upvote and an accept. There is no reputation penalty for downvotes.</p><h3>User reputation</h3><p>    The number next to a user's name is the sum of upvotes and accepted answers that user has collected.</p><h3>Post Ranking</h3><p>    On most pages  posts are ordered by their rank. This rank is a combination of the creation date (more recent dates have higher rank) and the number of votes and pageviews that the post has accumulated.</p><h3>Asking a good question</h3><p>    See <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202">Ten Simple Rules for Getting Help from Online Scientific Communities</a>.    Or <a href="http://www.biostars.org/p/75548/">How to ask Good Questions on Technical and Scientific Forums</a>.</p><h3>Keeping track of posts</h3><p>    You can bookmark any post by clicking on the bookmark symbol (<i class="icon-bookmark"></i>). This will add the post to your bookmark tab that is accesible from your account. Your activity tab on your profile page will show the responses that took place on the posts that you have interacted with. New activity will generate the new message icon (<i class="icon-envelope"></i>) in the navigation bar. Note that you can also subscribe to these messages as an RSS feed.</p> <h3>Becoming a moderator</h3><p>    Active users above a certain reputation treshold are periodically promoted to moderators.     You may also explicitly ask for moderation rights or suggest good candidates on the newsgroup. Inactive users that do not visit the site for extended periods of time may lose their moderation rights.</p> <h3>Markup</h3><p>    Post must be formatted with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.</p>
