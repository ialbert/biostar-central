            For example: <a href="/show/tag/galaxy+bwa+tutorial/">/show/tag/galaxy+bwa+tutorial/</a>. Similarly 
            to exclude a tag add the exclamation suffix to it like this <code>blast!</code>.
            You can combine them like so  <a href="/show/tag/tutorial+sequence+blast!/">/show/tag/tutorial+sequence+blast!/</a>
